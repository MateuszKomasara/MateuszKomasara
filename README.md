### Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Mateusz, Thanks for checking out my Profile.

A full stack software engineer from Ontario, Canada.

As a software engineer, I build full stack web applications for my clients. I have always had a keen interest in problem solving using technology,creating products and optimal solutions to aforementioned problems.

I have many interests and spent over a decade living and travelling overseas. This life experience working in a variety of jobs and interacting with a plethora of cultures and personalities has given me an edge in my ability to think outside of the box and to have a greater degree of reference.
